The idea here is to log all of the data I can log about local conditions.
 - EV chargers from EnelX
 - air quality stats from purple air
 - grid generation stats from gridwatch
 - MOER from wattTime
 - indoor stats from our Dyson
 - heating stats from thermo, Nest, Flair, and possibly Google Home
..... and then report on them. somehow.
